# Illusion.SceneSettingsExtended
PostProcessingEffects is a good plugin, but it achieves changes by loading a complete set of post processing effects and using those instead. However, the game has a few effects and settings already there and functional, the modification of them just isn't exposed. This exposes them in the Scene Effects tab in Settings so you can easily use them.

This plugin currently provides the following features for **KKS**:

- **Color Adjustments**: Includes all relevant settings for the LUTs.
- **Ambient Occlusion**: Full control over all settings.
- **Depth of Field**: Comprehensive adjustment options.
- **Vignette**: Includes all settings.
- **Fog**: Full customization capabilities.
- **Bloom**: Complete control over settings.
- **Sunshafts**: Includes all settings and fixes the sun origin to align with the actual sun.
- **Environment**: Adjust environmental lighting, skybox colors, intensity, and other related controls.
